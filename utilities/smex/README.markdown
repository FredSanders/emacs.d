## Smex

Smex is a M-x enhancement for Emacs. Built on top of Ido, it provides
a convenient interface to your recently and most frequently used
commands. And to all the other commands, too.

## Get started

* Download Smex.

* Make sure Emacs knows where to find smex.el. [(Find out more.)](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InstallingPackages)

* To auto-start Smex every time you open Emacs add these lines to your .emacs file:
        (require 'smex)
   Put this line at the very end of your .emacs file:
   (It should be run after all your other Emacs packages have been loaded.)
        (smex-initialize)
   [Starter Kit](http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/) users do the following:
        (eval-after-load "init.el" '(smex-initialize))
   Bind some keys:
        (global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'smex)
        (global-set-key (kbd "M-X") 'smex-major-mode-commands)
        (global-set-key (kbd "C-c M-x") 'smex-update-and-run)
        ;; This is your old M-x.
        (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c M-x") 'execute-extended-command)

* Run Smex. (Type M-x, if that's your key binding).

The commands are displayed in an Ido completion buffer, ordered by
relevance.  The 7 most recently executed commands come first, the
rest is sorted by frequency of use and in alphabetical order. (When
you run Smex for the first time, all you see is the alphabetical
order.)
   
Ido completion in 10 seconds: Typing selects matching commands:
e.g. 'lnmd' matches 'line-number-mode'. `C-s`/`C-r` switches to the
next/previous match. Enter executes the selected command.

### Show only major mode commands
`smex-major-mode-commands` runs Smex, limited only to commands that
are relevant to the active major mode. Try it with Dired or Magit.

### Command help
`C-h f`, while Smex is active, runs `describe-function` on the
currently selected command.

### Show unbound commands
`smex-show-unbound-commands` shows frequently used commands that have
no key bindings.

### Persistence
Smex keeps a file to save its state betweens Emacs sessions. The
default path is '~/smex.save'; you can change it by setting the
variable `smex-save-file`.

### Cache maintenance
To guarantee snappiness, Smex maintains command caches - which,
unfortunately, can not be automatically refreshed when new commands
are defined (or unloaded).

Run `smex-update-and-run` to update and invoke Smex, e.g. to access
commands of a library you have just loaded.

Additionally, you can teach Smex to update its caches after Emacs has
been idle for 60 seconds: `(smex-auto-update)`. (Provide an integer
argument for a custom time period in seconds.)

### History
Set `smex-history-length` to change the number of recent commands that
Smex keeps track of.

## Appendix

Smex is my first venture into Elisp. I'd be glad to receive patches,
comments and your considered criticism.

*Have fun with Smex!*
